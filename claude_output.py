This implements the basic framework of a Splendor game with classes for the main components. Additional logic would need to be added for actual gameplay. The use of docstrings, typing, and encapsulation makes it easy to understand and maintain.

Thank you, this is very helpful! A few followup questions:

How would you implement the card generation logic in _generate_deck? Should each card be hardcoded or is there a better way?

For _generate_gems, would a dictionary mapping gem color to quantity be appropriate?

In the play method, should each player take turns until someone reaches 15 points? How would you structure the logic?

Please show examples if you can.
